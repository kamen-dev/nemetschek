    <h1>Task Log</h1>

    <h2>What I Did</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Basic Angular routing for the form tabs.</dt>
      <dd>When I am working on tab 2, for example, sometimes it is easier
        to refresh the page instead of relying on Vite live reload.</dd>

      <dt>Basic Drag and Drop sorting for the list items in tab 2.</dt>
      <dd>I wanted a way to test if reordering the items invalidates the state matching.</dd>

      <dt>Basic messaging service for displaying errors.</dt>
      <dd>This is used only on the form page. It is not styled at all.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>What I Did Not Do</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>No tests except the ones generated by Angular CLI.</dt>
      <dd>If I have time, I will check a few tutorials.</dd>

      <dt>Proper styling/animations.</dt>
      <dd>Usually, most of the heavy lifting comes from a third-party library like PrimeNG or Angular Material.</dd>

      <dt>Tab 2 needs refactoring.</dt>
      <dd>It needs a sorting service or component, delete button template, etc.</dd>

      <dt>Proper state management.</dt>
      <dd>Passing properties to components is okay for 1-2 levels,
        but in large projects, things get hard to debug.
        I am planning to rework the app with NgRX if I have time/motivation.</dd>
