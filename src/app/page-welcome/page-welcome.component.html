    <h2>Tings I did</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Basic Angular routing for the form tabs.</dt>
      <dd>When I am working on tab2 for example, sometimes it is easier
        just to refresh the page instead of relying on the vite live reload.</dd>

      <dt>Basic Drag and Drop sorting for the list items in tab2.</dt>
      <dd>I just wanted a way to test if reordering of the items invalidates the state matching.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Tings I did not do</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Propper styling/animations.</dt>
      <dd>Usualy most of the heavy lifting comes from a third party library like PrimeNG/Angular Material.</dd>

      <dt>Tab 2 needs refactoring.</dt>
      <dd>It needs a sorting service, delete button template</dd>

      <dt>Propper state managment.</dt>
      <dd>Passing properties to components is ok for 1-2 levels, but on large projects tings get hard to debug.
        I am planing to rework the app with NgRX if I have time/motivation.</dd>
